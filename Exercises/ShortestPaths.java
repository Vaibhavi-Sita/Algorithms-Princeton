    Question 1
    Monotonic shortest path.

    design an ElogE algorithm to find a monotonic shortest path from s to every other vertex.
    A path is monotonic if the sequence of edge weights along the path are either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

    Question 2
    Critical edge.
    Given an edge-weighted digraph,

    Shortest path with one skippable edge.
