    Question 1
    Prefix free codes.
    In data compression, a set of binary strings is prefix free if no string is a prefix of another.
    For example, {01,10,0010,1111} is prefix free, but {01,10,0010,10100} is not because 10 is a prefix of 10100.
    Design an efficient algorithm to determine if a set of binary strings is prefix-free.
    The running time of your algorithm should be proportional the number of bits in all of the binary stings.

    Question 2
    Boggle.
    Boggle is a word game played on an 4-by-4 grid of tiles, where each tile contains one letter in the alphabet.
    The goal is to find all words in the dictionary that can be made by following a path of adjacent tiles (with no tile repeated),
    where two tiles are adjacent if they are horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbors.
