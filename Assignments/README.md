# Introduction to Algorithms

Cousera online course, [Introduction to Algorithms][1], created by Princeton
University, taught by: _Kevin Wayne_, Senior Lecturer and _Robert Sedgewick_,
Professor.

This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs
to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and
scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. Part I covers
elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. Part II focuses
on graph- and string-processing algorithms.

This codebase only covers the Part I. However, all my assignments have score of
100 percent, so feel free to read them if you need any inspiration.

Assignment | Name | Score
:--- | :--- | ---
Week 1 | [Percolation][w1] | 100/100
Week 2 | [Queues][w2] | 100/100
Week 3 | [Collinear][w3] | 100/100
Week 4 | [8 Puzzle][w4] | 100/100
Week 5 | [Kd-Trees][w5] | 100/100

At the end, I wish you all a happy coding! :sunglasses::man_technologist:
